  <p>Another sun-soaked season comes to a close. Previous summers revolved around research, so I was happy to “break” into finance this year. It’s been a tremendously interesting internship, owing to some unusual circumstances and a fantastic team. I worked at a large commercial bank on the top floor (well, the C-Suite occupies the floor above us) and it was a thrill walking through the hustle of downtown every morning. I’ll be honest - pressing my floor in the elevator still hasn’t gotten old after 10 weeks.</p>

<p>A full-time hire started the same day as me and we were both assigned to the same portfolio. Working with him was a learning opportunity in and of itself; he was incredibly proactive with great interpersonal skills, and served as a good example for how to act as a new hire. We both hit the ground running from the beginning.</p>

<p>The asset class that we focused on during the first few weeks was mortgages, specifically, the subprime mortgage and mortgage-backed securities portfolios. Older people will be familiar with the fact that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">subprime mortgage crisis</a> caused the 2007-2009 economic recession. Back then, I was still a kid and before this internship, I barely understood what a mortgage was, let alone the factors that went into causing the crisis. A friend recently recommended <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/">The Big Short</a> to me and I found it an entertaining and educational look at how subprime mortgages and mortgage-backed securities did the damage it did. I had the opportunity to compare the 2015 model with the 2010 model and, put shortly, the model’s assumptions can vastly influence the result of its calculations with an impact of billions.</p>

<p>Going through these portfolios was a steep learning curve. Part of modelling this portfolio meant that we had to pull data from various databases. The subprime mortgage portfolio sees considerably more trading activity than all the other portfolios so we had to clearly understand how the data flowed from an accounting perspective. In order to do that, we needed to know the life cycle of an MBS at every step. I spent considerable time</p>

<p>Every intern also got a mentor. Mine was a former math professor and one of my former interviewers. Out of three people, he had asked the toughest technical questions. He would often give me lectures on the spot covering various mathematical theory, banking, financial news, and was comfortable going into detail. I appreciate all the time he gave me, especially considering how busy he was. What made him a good mentor was simply the fact that he tried his best to “keep me in the loop” - he brought me to all of his meetings, showed me the things he was working on, and encouraged me to ask questions often.</p>

<h3 id="more-technical">More Technical…</h3>
<p>Our work revolves around implementing Basel III, which is an international regulatory framework for banks that seeks to establish good banking practices for maintaining adequate capital, stress testing our models, and managing market liquidity risk.</p>

<p>My group focused on capital adequacy. For each of the bank’s portfolios, we would model the probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD). Those two models along with the exposure at default (EAD) would give us the expected loss for a given portfolio. Under Basel III, the bank would have to hold enough “regulatory capital” to cover this expected loss. Mathematically,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{Expected Loss} = PD \times LGD \times EAD</script>
