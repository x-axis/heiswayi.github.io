  <p>Another sun-soaked season comes to a close. I was so happy to “break” into finance this year and it’s been a tremendously interesting internship, owing to some unusual circumstances and a fantastic team. I worked at a large commercial bank on the top floor (well, the C-Suite occupies the floor above us) and I’ll be honest - pressing my floor in the elevator still hasn’t gotten old after 10 weeks.</p>

<p>A full-time hire started the same day as me and we were both assigned to the same portfolio. Working with him was a learning opportunity in and of itself; he was incredibly proactive with great interpersonal skills, and served as a good example for how to act as a new hire. We both hit the ground running.</p>

<p>We were on the subprime mortgage and mortgage-backed securities portfolios. Older people will be familiar with how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">subprime mortgage crisis</a> caused the 2007-2009 economic recession. Back then, I was still a kid and before this internship, I barely understood what a mortgage was, let alone what happened. A friend recommended <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/">The Big Short</a> to me and I found it an entertaining and educational look at how these did the damage they did.</p>

<p>From the get-go, it felt like I was drinking from the firehose. The learning curve was steep, mostly because there was just so much information. We needed to pull data from various databases but in order to know what sources to pull it from, we needed to understand what’s in the portfolio and how the assets worked. Not just conceptually, but also from an accounting perspective in understanding how the bank structures its data. I must have read hundreds of pages of documentation and paperwork. I made a lot of flowcharts to help me process it all. Microsoft Visio is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Every intern also got a mentor. Mine was one of my interviewers and out of three people, he had asked the toughest technical questions. He was a former math professor and I don’t think I could have had a better mentor! He was always busy, but would often give me lectures on the spot from mathematical theory to financial news to the bank’s history. I think what set him apart was that he didn’t just give me guidance, but also opportunities for me to set myself apart. He brought me to all of his meetings whether or not they related to my work, and often “went to bat” for me with my manager by recommending additional projects for me to take on. With his support, I was able to do a lot in 10 weeks. I am pretty grateful and I want to be what he was to me, to somebody else someday.</p>

<p>There is so much I could say about this internship, but I think I’ll just stick to the key takeaways.</p>

<h3 id="general-life-stuff">General Life Stuff</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Get the information you need.</strong> This was said over and over again in my first week - being proactive means asking questions early and asking questions often. Don’t waste your time.</li>
  <li><strong>Know what makes you happy in a job.</strong> We had a bunch of team meetings just on this topic, talking about so many things. Compensation, work/life balance, recognition, opportunities for advancement, etc. Your happiness is influenced more by what your day-to-day looks like than what your specific area of finance is.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="personal-lessons">Personal Lessons</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Deep work.</li>
  <li>Workaholic.</li>
  <li>Be authentic.</li>
</ul>
